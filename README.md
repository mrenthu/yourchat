# NGBoiler

A simple boilerplate for building Angular apps.

## Why

To let me focus on creating high-quality code than time-consuming DX features.

# Features

  - **Commitlint** and **Commitizen**: For commit control in repo
  - **Husky**: Git Hooks
- Code Quality
  - **Prettier** as formatter and **ESLint** as linter
  - Tests with disabled watching

## Getting Started

This is how to use this boilerplate

### Way I recommend

**Clicking "Use As Template button on GitHub"**, to setup your own repo, rather than degitting or cloning it.

## To Do

Your tasks list after cloning this template

- [] Rename `LICENSE` file
- [] If you have open-source project, setup `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [] Edit `README.md`
- [] Edit `package.json`
